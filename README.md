## My process 📜

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned 🧠💡

This is a newbie challange, but a great one, this was a kick-start for me to use _**CSS grid**_, I was little confused at my first sight of the project, whether to go with CSS grid or flexbox, i was little bias towards flexbox as I used it the most, but I figured out by seeing few videos that grid is more flexible than flexbox, I watched few videos of [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) which helped to get a good understanding of grid layouts and how _**grid-template-areas**_ are so efficient for responsive web design.

Also i was wondering how i could make the fontsize responsive, then i went through few articles and videos which helped me in defining the fontsize based on **vw (view width)**, but i would have gone wrong if had used this trick this without watching [Kevin's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo&t=616s) where he expanined how just using this **vw** can go wrong and how using min() 0r max() can fix the issue.

### Continued development 🏗

I used CSS grid for responsive design, it was both fun and frustrating, but finally i managed to get the output as i expected, 

I will try to use CSS grid and get a good grip on using it for my responsive web designs.

### Useful resources 📚	🗃

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - best place to get the complete understanding of css properites, they have a search bar which is really cool in getting the right resource without wasting time wandering around.
- [Kevin Powell's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - will have videos on almost all the css needs.
- [Mosh Hamedani's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh) - he has a git beginner video, which is really helpful.
